    "As you have learned so far in lesson 2, control flow in Python is the order in which a program executes code, and it is the basis of your program's logic and structure. Control flow is implemented by using *statements* in Python. A *statement* is defined as \"instructions that the interpreter can execute\". Examples of control flow statements in Python include:\n",
    "* *if-elif-else*\n",
    "* *for* and *while* loops\n",

Even a small difference in interest rates or monthly payments can make a large difference in how much you ultimately pay for your mortgage.  However, these details are often buried in masses of paperwork--so it pays to be able to calculate the long-term cost of a mortgage yourself.\n",

Every month, the amount you owe (the balance) first increases due to interest:  1/12 of the interest rate times the current balance.  Then the balance decreases due to your monthly payment.\n",

In the first month, the interest increases the balance by $\\$416.67$, and then your payment reduces it by $\\$500$, for a remaining balance of $\\$99,916.67$.

    "4.  If you accidentally create an infinite loop during development and testing, interrupt or restart the kernel.  See the `Kernel` menu up top.\n",
    "5.  Use the modulus or $\\%$  operator to separate the years and months.\n",
    "6.  Your program should only display the columns requested, and the rows should be formatted to appear under the appropriate heading.\n",
    "7.  Because this is an iPython notebook, which is inherently interactive, don't use the `input` function to make your code interactive.  Instead, set the values of the input (such as the interest rate) as variables defined at the top of your code.  Alternatively, if you write one or more functions, you can set the input as the arguments of your function(s).\n"
